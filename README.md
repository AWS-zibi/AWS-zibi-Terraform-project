# üöÄ DevOps Project ‚Äì AWS ECS + RDS + CI/CD

## üìå Project Overview
  This project demonstrates a complete DevOps pipeline for deploying a containerized Node.js application on **AWS ECS Fargate** with **RDS** as the database, automated using Infrastructure as Code (Terraform/CloudFormation) and **CI/CD(CodePipeline)**.  
The deployment ensures scalability, high availability, and observability using **CloudWatch** & **Terraform** & **ECS**.

**Part 1: Infrastructure as Code**

[Terraform-Setup.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22144108/Terraform-Setup.pdf)
VPC with public and private subnets across 2 Availability Zones
Internet Gateway attached to the VPC
NAT Gateway in public subnet for private subnet routing
EC2 ‚Üí Target Groups ‚Üí ‚Üí Targets (targets healthy).
EC2 ‚Üí Security Groups for ALB‚ÄëSG/ECS‚ÄëSG/RDS‚ÄëSG (inbound rules visible).
Auto Scaling Group with EC2 instances in private subnets



**Part 2: Application Deployment**

[Node.ls-Application.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22144146/Node.ls-Application.pdf)
ECS ‚Üí Clusters ‚Üí ‚Üí Services: show Service Running/Desired, Tasks running.
RDS ‚Üí Databases ‚Üí (status = Available, engine, security group).
SECRET MENAGER-> Credentials-> (using database credentials in secret menages).



**Part 3: CI/CD Pipeline**
  
[Part 3 CICD Pipeline.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22144300/Part.3.CICD.Pipeline.pdf)

 **Source Stage**  
 Trigger pipeline on Git push to main branch  
 Pull source code from the GitHub repository  

**Build Stage**  
 Build and test Docker image  
 Run basic security scans on the image  
 Push Docker image to AWS ECR  

 **Deploy Stage**  
 Deploy application to staging environment  
 Deploy to production with manual approval



**Part 4: Monitoring & Logging**

[Monitoring_Backup.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22144354/Monitoring_Backup.pdf)

**CloudWatch Metrics & Dashboards**
 Set up custom metrics for the application  
 Create CloudWatch dashboard with key metrics (CPU, Memory, RequestCount, Latency)  

 **Logging**
 Centralized logging using CloudWatch Logs  
 Aggregate logs from ECS/EC2 containers  

 **Health Checks**
 Configure application health endpoints (e.g., /health)  
 Set ALB health check paths and thresholds  

 **RDS Backup**
 Enable automated backups for RDS instance  
 Optionally enable snapshot scheduling for disaster recovery

**Back_UP**
 Configure backup retention period (e.g., 7‚Äì30 days)  



**Add Your Application URL**

ALB DNS: EC2 ‚Üí Load Balancers ‚Üí <devops-app-alb-147514442.ap-south-1.elb.amazonaws.com> ‚Üí Domain name <themetadatas.in>.
Test in browser and with curl:
**curl -i http://devops-app-alb-147514442.ap-south-1.elb.amazonaws.com/health**
If using HTTPS + domain (Route 53 + ACM): ensure certificate validated and ALB listener 443 uses it.

**ENDPOINT**
https://devops.themetadatas.in
